## Overview of Project
HTML and CSS have no lead to learning and utilizing JavaScript to build dynamic webpages. This module setout to introduce us to the JavaScript language, educate us on some of the history and major updates (ES6+), and begin utilizing JS to solve problems.

### Purpose of Project
This week our psuedo-client, Dana, is interested in building an attractive and user-friendly webpage for UFO enthusiasts to gather the latest intel from an out of this world database. Her goal was to present the data table of UFO sightings to page visitors and allow them to search and discover specific witness accounts of alien activity based on a number of criteria.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Project
It's one thing to filter an excel sheet. Putting a table onto a web page, and then creating capacity for page visitors to easily filter and review the table all within the welcoming environment of a visually appealing GUI is actually out of this world. 

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are interesting in that developers tend to navigate between all three languages at any given time. Keeping track of how all of the different files tie together was a valuable lesson. It's great getting a feel for how the file and folder structures are best practiced to keep everything organized, and that helped compartmentalize the project this week.

Once started, the storyboarding process to conceptualize a design, start fragmenting out the specific elements, and then create building blocks was a great logical process development that will make future projects much more manageable.
