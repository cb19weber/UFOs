  <h4>DU Data Analytics Bootcamp: Moduel 11 - JavaScript and Bootstrap</h4>
</div>

## Overview of Project
HTML and CSS have no lead to learning and utilizing JavaScript to build dynamic webpages. This module setout to introduce us to the JavaScript language, educate us on some of the history and major updates (ES6+), and begin utilizing JS to solve problems.

### Purpose of Project
This week our psuedo-client, Dana, is interested in building an attractive and user-friendly webpage for UFO enthusiasts to gather the latest intel from an out of this world database. Her goal was to present the data table of UFO sightings to page visitors and allow them to search and discover specific witness accounts of alien activity based on a number of criteria.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Project
It's one thing to filter an excel sheet. Putting a table onto a web page, and then creating capacity for page visitors to easily filter and review the table all within the welcoming environment of a visually appealing GUI is actually out of this world. 

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are interesting in that developers tend to navigate between all three languages at any given time. Keeping track of how all of the different files tie together was a valuable lesson. It's great getting a feel for how the file and folder structures are best practiced to keep everything organized, and that helped compartmentalize the project this week.

Once started, the storyboarding process to conceptualize a design, start fragmenting out the specific elements, and then create building blocks was a great logical process development that will make future projects much more manageable.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>Walking through the layout to building each element and seeing the structure take place was extremely satisfying. And you can definitely see how the storyboarding process lends itself to really any design process, taking a vision and breaking it into smaller building tasks to eventually arive at something pretty impressive.</p>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Challenges and Goals
Without question the biggest challenge of the weekly challenge was looping through the filter elements to create a dynamically updating filter. Using d3 to read user activity and respond is such an incredible and powerful tool for which there are infinite applications to enhance user experience. This same general page design could be recreated to analyze financial instruments and reports, geographical data, housing searches, you name it.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I overcame the looping challenge and was able to arive at a really cool end point for this module that I hope Dana would be very satisfied with. I'm also really looking forward to seeing how there might be some integration potential between Python and JavaScript. I noticed that the dataset used for the UFO sightings looked strikingly similar to a Python list of dictionaries.

## Results
I read a great article this week on the pathway of a developer. As we're continuing to branch out into other tools and languages, it can feel a bit overwhelming. But being able to see the tools in action is really incredible. I'm excited to continue the learning process and expand on JavaScript.
